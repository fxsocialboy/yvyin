# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Include test and validation tasks whenever the specification or
constitution requires proof of accuracy, latency, cost, privacy handling,
fallback behavior, or user-task success. Do not omit validation work for
affected constraints.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent
implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project; adjust based on plan.md structure

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management
- [ ] T010 Define measurement hooks for task completion time, edit count, and failure recovery
- [ ] T011 Define privacy and data lifecycle controls required by the feature

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready; user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (add all that apply)

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Latency or responsiveness validation for [flow]
- [ ] T015 [P] [US1] Fallback and recovery validation for [failure mode]

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T016 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
- [ ] T017 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
- [ ] T018 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T016, T017)
- [ ] T019 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T020 [US1] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T021 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations
- [ ] T022 [US1] Implement correction, undo, or retry path for the story's failure cases

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2 (add all that apply)

- [ ] T023 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T024 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
- [ ] T025 [P] [US2] Quality-budget validation for [accuracy/latency/cost/privacy constraint]

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T026 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T027 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T028 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T029 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)
- [ ] T030 [US2] Implement any required privacy, retention, or user-control path

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 and 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 (add all that apply)

- [ ] T031 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T032 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
- [ ] T033 [P] [US3] Real-task validation for the story's primary success metric

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T034 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T035 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T036 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX Validate task completion time and edit-count improvements against baseline
- [ ] TXXX Audit data retention, upload boundaries, and user-control behavior
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies; can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion; blocks all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
- User stories can then proceed in parallel if staffed
- User stories can also proceed sequentially in priority order
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational; no dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational; may integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational; may integrate with US1 or US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Validation tasks for constrained metrics MUST be included when the story affects them
- Tests MUST be written and fail before implementation when the spec requires them
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within Phase 2
- Once Foundational phase completes, user stories can start in parallel if team capacity allows
- Tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"
Task: "Latency or responsiveness validation for [flow]"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. Stop and validate User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy or demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup and Foundational
2. Add User Story 1, test independently, deploy or demo
3. Add User Story 2, test independently, deploy or demo
4. Add User Story 3, test independently, deploy or demo
5. Ensure each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup and Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
3. Developer A: User Story 1
4. Developer B: User Story 2
5. Developer C: User Story 3
6. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Stop at each checkpoint to validate the story independently
- Avoid vague tasks, same-file conflicts, or cross-story dependencies that break independence
